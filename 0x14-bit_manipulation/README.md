### C - Bit manipulation
	1 byte is equal to 8 bits
The bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name is a portmanteau of binary digit.[1] The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either "1" or "0", but other representations such as true/false, yes/no, on/off, or +/âˆ’ are also commonly used.

### Bit Manipulation in C

The bitwise operators are used to manipulate the bits of
integral operands both signed and unsigned.  
C provides six bitwise operators for bit manipulation.
These operators act on integral operands (char, short, int and
long) represented as a string of binary digits.
###   Bitwise Operators
  logical operators:

  (unary) bitwise complement: ~
  
  bitwise and: & &=
  
  bitwise or: | |=
  
  bitwise exclusive or: ^ ^=
  
  shift operators:
  
  left shift: << <<=
  
  right shift: >> >>=
